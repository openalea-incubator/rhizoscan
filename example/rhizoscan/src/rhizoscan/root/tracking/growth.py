      The tree covering path given by `path_elt` and `elt_path` should:
        - be a graph-covering path set that covers at path start only: 
            p1 = [1,2]
            p2 = [1,3,4]
            p3 = [1,3,5]
        - have at least the last segment of all path not covered by other path
      
    :Path merging:
      Mergin happen if:
        1. a path 'p1' last segment is not terminal: it has at least one 
           outgoing segment 'o1'
        2. a path 'p2' contains 'o1' and all previous segments are covered by at 
           least one other path
           
      Then the end 'p2' starting at 'o1' is appended at the end of 'p1' and
      (the remaining of) 'p2' is removed
    
      Merges is searched for in reverse `top_order`. If at one step, multiple
      merges are possible, the order by which such merges are chosen follows
      given `priority`
    
    :Outputs:
       - updated `path_elt`
       - updated `elt_path`
       - remove path, as a dictionary (path-index,path_elt)
       - a (debug) dictionary giving the merging states that occured at each 
         element of the graph
         
    :todo:
      replace priority by a a better selection method, ex:
       - take into account to relative position (merging direction)
       - take into account estimated/previous order?
      init path should not be allowed to grow too quickly
